# MvcMessageLogger
Launch Mod 3 Project Starter Code

## Lonely

`Lonely` is free to use, user based message logger. On `lonely` you can create an account and/or login and once you log in you have full access to `lonelys` capabilities and features. A user is able to create messages and have them pinned to their account. There's no other user interaction so you're basically talking to yourself, but you dont care! You're `lonely`! 


## Goal 

Our goal is to connect users with no friends to their inner self. `"Its organic mannn"` And give a sense of comfort, a place they can say anything with no judgement
