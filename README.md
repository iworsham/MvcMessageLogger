# MvcMessageLogger
Launch Mod 3 Project Starter Code

## Lonely

Lonely is free to use, user based message logger. On lonely you can create an account and/or login and once you log in you have full access to lonely's capabilities and features. A user is able to create messages and have them pinned to their account. There's no other user interaction so you're basically talking to yourself, but you dont care! You're lonely! 


## Goal 

Our goal is to connect users with no friends to their inner self. "Its organic mannn"
